# Algolizer - Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

**Algolizer** is a Java-based sorting algorithm visualizer that provides an intuitive and educational way to observe how different sorting algorithms work. This tool is designed to help students, educators, and enthusiasts better understand the inner workings of popular sorting algorithms through real-time visualizations.

## Features

- **Real-Time Visualization**: Watch as various sorting algorithms process and sort data step by step.
- **Multiple Sorting Algorithms**: Supports visualization for a variety of sorting algorithms including:
  - Bubble Sort
  - Quick Sort
  - Merge Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Heap Sort
- **Customizable Settings**:
  - Adjust the speed of the sorting process.
  - Change the size of the array being sorted.
  - Randomize the array to see how the algorithm handles different input scenarios.
- **User-Friendly Interface**:
  - Easy-to-use controls for selecting algorithms, adjusting speed, and randomizing the array.
  - Clear visualization with color-coded bars to indicate different stages of the sorting process.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Java 8 or later**: Ensure that you have Java installed on your machine.
